Wars impact not only the people who experience them, but also the culture as a whole. Using film metadata sets extracted from Wikipedia and Freebase, we explore the impact of war on film. What is the impact of war on film production? How does each country show the war? Or doesn't show it?

During wartime, it is common for filmmakers to produce war-themed films that explore the experiences of soldiers, civilians, and others directly affected by the conflict. These films may focus on the heroism and sacrifice of soldiers, the atrocities and suffering of war, or the psychological effects of combat on individuals and families.

After wars are over, filmmakers may continue to produce war-themed films that explore the long-term effects of conflict on society, or that revisit the events of war from a historical perspective. These films may take a more critical view of the war, examining its causes, consequences and legacy.

### War films in cinema...

War films never had such a large share of film production as during World War II.

**From 1939 to 1945 roughly 10 % of films were War Films.**

Let's have a look on the proportion of war films over the years:

To better illustrate the impact of war, we zoom on two wars: the World War II and the Vietnam War.






Case Study : WW2
----------------

#### WW2 recap

[World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations - including all the major powers - who ended up forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the largest war in history, directly involving over 100 million people in more than 30 countries. In a state of "total war", the main participants put all their economic, industrial and scientific capacities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by massive civilian deaths, including the Holocaust, and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centers, it resulted in between 50 and 70 million deaths.

Lets do sentiment analysis...
-----------------------------

For the period 1930-1955

#### Loser countries : 
In **Germany**, we can observe a negative sentiment in the post war period (1946-1951). We can note that in 1939, at the beginning of the war, we find the most positive year for German movies. Perhaps this was to encourage soldiers to fight.\\
In **Italy**, we find a post war period that is very negative, (1945-1951) as in Germany. \\
In **Japan**, the pre war period was positive (until 1936) and since then, it seems to be mostly negative.\\

#### Winner countries :
In **France**, we can find a very positive year in 1945, the victory year.\\
In the **United Kingdom**, we observe a negative period during the war (1939-1943) and another post war (1946-1952). These periods are cut by the 1945 year that comes very positive, as it is the victory year for the UK.\\
In the **United States of America**, we see a clear threshold (1942, the year USA comes into the WW2 conflict), when all the movies carry a negative very negative sentiment. We can note a very negative year in 1939, the start of WW2. \\

Case Study : Vietnam War
------------------------

#### Vietnam War recap

The [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) was a military conflict that took place in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s. It was a conflict between the communist North Vietnam, supported by its communist allies, and the non-communist South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries. The United States became involved in the conflict in an effort to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. The war was marked by a high number of casualties and widespread destruction, and it had a significant impact on both Vietnam and the United States. The Vietnam War ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) to North Vietnamese forces, and Vietnam was reunified under communist rule.
