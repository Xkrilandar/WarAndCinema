title: War impact on cinema
subtitle: Looking at wars trough the lens of cinema
---

Wars have a strong impact not only on the people that live through it, but also on society as a whole. 
Using datasets of meta data of films scraped from wikipedia and freebase, weâ€™d like to explore war's impact on cinema themes, genres and general sentiment.
Are more war movies made during a war or just after ? 
Are war movies always sad ? 
How do these themes change across different wars, and across the different affected countries ? 
What wars from the last century do we see most often in modern cinema, and does the sentiment towards these wars seem to change ? 
The goal is to see the long term effect of wars on arts and culture, through the lens of cinema and how they are represented across time.
