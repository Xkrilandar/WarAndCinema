title: War impact on cinema
subtitle: Looking at wars trough the lens of cinema
---

<p>Wars have a strong impact not only on the people that live through it, but also on society as a whole. 
Using datasets of meta data of films scraped from wikipedia and freebase, we’d like to explore war&#39;s impact on cinema themes, genres and general sentiment.
Are more war movies made during a war or just after ? 
Are war movies always sad ? 
How do these themes change across different wars, and across the different affected countries ? 
What wars from the last century do we see most often in modern cinema, and does the sentiment towards these wars seem to change ? 
The goal is to see the long term effect of wars on arts and culture, through the lens of cinema and how they are represented across time.</p>

<p>War has had a significant impact on cinema, both in terms of the themes and genres of films that are produced, as well as the overall sentiment and perspective on war that is portrayed in these films.</p>
<p>During times of war, it is common for filmmakers to produce more war-themed films that explore the experiences of soldiers, civilians, and other individuals who are directly impacted by the conflict. These films may focus on the heroism and sacrifice of soldiers, the atrocities and suffering of war, or the psychological effects of combat on individuals and families.</p>
<p>After wars have ended, filmmakers may continue to produce war-themed films that explore the long-term effects of the conflict on society, or that revisit the events of the war from a historical perspective. These films may take a more critical view of the war, examining its causes, consequences, and legacy.</p>
<p>In terms of genres, war films are often classified as dramas, historical dramas, or war films. However, war can also be a theme in other genres, such as comedy, romance, or science fiction.</p>
<p>The overall sentiment of war films can vary greatly depending on the perspective and context of the film. Some war films may be heroic and patriotic, while others may be more critical and anti-war. The sentiment towards specific wars may also change over time, as society&#39;s perspective on the conflict shifts and evolves.</p>
<p>Using datasets of film metadata, it would be possible to explore these trends in more detail, examining the patterns and variations in war-themed films across different wars and different countries, and looking at how the themes and sentiments of these films change over time. This could provide valuable insights into the long-term impact of wars on cinema and society.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-ww2">Case Study : WW2</h2>

<p align="justify">World War II was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world&#39;s nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries. In a state of &quot;total war&quot;, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million people were killed), it resulted in 50 million to over 70 million fatalities.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-vietnam-war">Case Study : Vietnam War</h2>

<p align="justify">The Vietnam War was a military conflict that took place in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s. It was a conflict between the communist North Vietnam, supported by its communist allies, and the non-communist South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries. The United States became involved in the conflict in an effort to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. The war was marked by a high number of casualties and widespread destruction, and it had a significant impact on both Vietnam and the United States. The Vietnam War ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) to North Vietnamese forces, and Vietnam was reunified under communist rule.</p>
