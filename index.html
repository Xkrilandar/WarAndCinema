title: War impact on cinema
subtitle: Looking at wars trough the lens of cinema
---

<p>Wars have a strong impact not only on the people that live through it, but also on society as a whole. 
Using datasets of meta data of films scraped from wikipedia and freebase, weâ€™d like to explore war&#39;s impact on cinema themes, genres and general sentiment.
Are more war movies made during a war or just after ? 
Are war movies always sad ? 
How do these themes change across different wars, and across the different affected countries ? 
What wars from the last century do we see most often in modern cinema, and does the sentiment towards these wars seem to change ? 
The goal is to see the long term effect of wars on arts and culture, through the lens of cinema and how they are represented across time.</p>

<p>War has had a significant impact on cinema, both in terms of the themes and genres of films that are produced, as well as the overall sentiment and perspective on war that is portrayed in these films.</p>
<p>During times of war, it is common for filmmakers to produce more war-themed films that explore the experiences of soldiers, civilians, and other individuals who are directly impacted by the conflict. These films may focus on the heroism and sacrifice of soldiers, the atrocities and suffering of war, or the psychological effects of combat on individuals and families.</p>
<p>After wars have ended, filmmakers may continue to produce war-themed films that explore the long-term effects of the conflict on society, or that revisit the events of the war from a historical perspective. These films may take a more critical view of the war, examining its causes, consequences, and legacy.</p>
<p>In terms of genres, war films are often classified as dramas, historical dramas, or war films. However, war can also be a theme in other genres, such as comedy, romance, or science fiction.</p>
<p>The overall sentiment of war films can vary greatly depending on the perspective and context of the film. Some war films may be heroic and patriotic, while others may be more critical and anti-war. The sentiment towards specific wars may also change over time, as society&#39;s perspective on the conflict shifts and evolves.</p>
<p>Using datasets of film metadata, it would be possible to explore these trends in more detail, examining the patterns and variations in war-themed films across different wars and different countries, and looking at how the themes and sentiments of these films change over time. This could provide valuable insights into the long-term impact of wars on cinema and society.</p>
